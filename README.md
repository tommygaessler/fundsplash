[Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1781697)

*[Fundsplash](http://fundsplash.com) is a **crowdfunding** **website** where **[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)** **photographers** can **post** their **best** pictures in hopes of **raising** **money** to **fund** their next **adventure!***

*In **return,** the **photographers** will **share** their **incredible** **new** photos back to **[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com),** for **everyone** to use **free** of charge!*


##### What problem does your project solve?

> [Fundsplash](http://fundsplash.com) solves two problems, with both the photographer and the viewer:

  > 1. Most photographers with amazing talent don't have the money to travel to new places to share their gift of photography. The ones who do have the money to travel often, do not give out their pictures for everyone to use for free.


  > 1. Most people who enjoy and use great photography don't have enough photos to use, or the time to go to new places and see things for themselves. If they do have the time, chances are they suck at taking pictures.

##### Who has this problem?

> The photographer has a shortage of money, and the viewer has a shortage of great, new photos.

##### How will your project solve this problem?

> My project will showcase the photographers [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@jeremy_thomas) photos and the user can fund more royalty free photography through Stripe.

##### What inputs does it need?

> This app needs the photographer the user chooses to fund, and the amount being funded by the user.

##### What outputs does it produce?

> The output will show a beautiful progress bar, showing how much funding needs to happen before the goal is reached.

##### What web APIs will it use?

> I will be using the [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers), [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs), and [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/) APIs.

##### What technologies will it use?
> The technologies used will be JavaScript, PHP, SCSS, and HTML.

##### What additional features will it have?

> The user will be able to use a suggested donation, a custom donation, or pass on the donation and load another account to possibly fund.

*With my app, there will **always** be enough **new**, **free**, **beautiful** [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) **photography** to **use**, or just **enjoy!***
